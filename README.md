# Deep Learning for NZX Stock Market Prediction

## Project Overview
This project conducts a detailed comparative analysis of several deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, and hybrid models like CNN-LSTM and GRU-LSTM, for predicting stock market trends, specifically focusing on the New Zealand (NZX) stock market. The analysis is based on the S&P/NZX 50 index daily dataset.

## Models Evaluated
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **CNN-LSTM (Hybrid Model)**
- **GRU-LSTM (Hybrid Model)**

## Dataset
The dataset includes daily stock prices from the S&P/NZX 50 index from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, sourced from Yahoo Finance. It includes features like open, high, low, close prices, and volume of stocks traded.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data normalisation and sequence creation for time series prediction.
2. **Model Development**: Separate models were developed for LSTM, GRU, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and GRU-LSTM.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Models were trained and validated. Performance metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², and MAPE were used to evaluate model efficacy.

## Results
The GRU-LSTM model demonstrated superior performance across all metrics for the NZX dataset. The project report provides a detailed explanation of the implementation, evaluation, and findings.
